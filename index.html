<!-- Without CSS The header text is larger than the body text, there's space between the header and the body,
the list has a numbered format, and the whole thing is in the Times New Roman font.
If you have an HTML document that doesn't contain any CSS,
you'll see the browser default styles.Examples of browser default styles include the size of Heading 1 elements,
the amount of line spacing between paragraphs, and the default text color and link color.
All browsers use pretty much the same default style.
